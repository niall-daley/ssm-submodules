| 1082469 | webpack-dev-server>http-proxy-middleware>http-proxy | Denial of Service in http-proxy | Versions of `http-proxy` prior to 1.18.1 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. An HTTP request with a long body triggers an `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` unhandled exception that crashes the proxy server. This is only possible when the proxy server sets headers in the proxy request using the `proxyReq.setHeader` function.   <br /><br />For a proxy server running on `http://localhost:3000`, the following curl request triggers the unhandled exception:  <br />```curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000 -d "$(python -c 'print("x"*1025)')"```<br /><br /><br />## Recommendation<br /><br />Upgrade to version 1.18.1 or later | 0 | https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6x33-pw7p-hmpq |
